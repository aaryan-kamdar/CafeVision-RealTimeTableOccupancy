# CaféVision Real Time Restaurant-Table-Occupancy-Detection
CaféVision is an AI-powered system designed to enhance restaurant operations by providing real-time insights into table occupancy. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques, it classifies tables as "occupied" or "unoccupied" by analyzing video feeds, thereby eliminating the need for physical sensors.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides up-to-the-minute data on table availability, reducing customer wait times and improving satisfaction.

- **Operational Efficiency:** Automates occupancy detection, allowing staff to focus on service, leading to better resource allocation.

- **Scalability:** As a software-based solution, it can be easily deployed across multiple locations without requiring expensive hardware installations.

**Technical Approach:**

CaféVision leverages existing video surveillance systems and employs object detection models like YOLOv11 and Detectron2 to identify and classify tables and patrons. By integrating a proximity-based analysis, the system accounts for transient movements, dynamically determining genuine table occupancy without additional hardware.

**Advantages Over Traditional Methods:**

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Eliminates the need for dedicated hardware such as infrared or pressure sensors, reducing deployment and maintenance costs.

- **Flexibility:** Utilizes existing infrastructure, making it adaptable to various restaurant layouts and sizes.

- **Accuracy:** Employs state-of-the-art computer vision models to accurately detect and classify occupancy status.

By implementing CaféVision, restaurants can optimize table management, enhance customer experiences, and streamline operations through innovative AI-driven solutions.
